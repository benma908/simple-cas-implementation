# simple-cas-implementation

## As repo name shown, this project is a Single Sign On system writen in Java (version 1.8). 

## It is based major on some frameworks as following:

  - Spring
  - Spring MVC
  - Jedis
  - Apache Http Components (To ticket validate)
  - async-http-client (To asynchronous logout)

### Somehow, it isn't a clear servlet project.
